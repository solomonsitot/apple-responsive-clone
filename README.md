# apple-responsive-clone
here is an attempt to clone apple's website
the code is hard codded (plain code) except using a little bit of bootstrap library for esponsive purpose.Other than that the HTML and CSS are plain code and the javascript is also plain code (DOM manipulation).

NOTE: it might not be the same as current page of apple since apple changes their website every time but I hope the main features are still there.
      also I only clone there home page only because apples have a tone of pages and navigations and it's kind of time consuming to do all  because of that all the navigation links are empty(#). 
      Here is how it looks:
